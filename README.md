# Autonomous Insurance Claims Processing Agent

## Overview
This project implements a lightweight agent for processing FNOL (First Notice of Loss) documents.
The agent extracts key claim information, validates mandatory fields, and routes claims to the
appropriate workflow based on predefined business rules.

The solution focuses on clarity, robustness, and explainability rather than heavy AI models.
